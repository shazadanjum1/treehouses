 ## *3* Things About Me
 1. ### I am a huge comic book geek (for DC and their imprints mostly).
     
      **This is what I'm reading now:**

 2. ### I love to watch cult classics and horror movies, especially the bad ones  
 
  > I think my initial view of it is that 'The Room' has succeeded in being the best  
  > bad movie because it's the most earnest. I feel like it's a film that comes from  
  > the heart, and somebody's really trying to send a message about their life and  
  >their view on the human experience.
 
  >Greg Sestero

 3. ### I am a senior computer science student who gets to nerd out at [GS](https://www.georgiasouthern.edu/)
