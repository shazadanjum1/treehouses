About Me
----
Hello Everyone,

My name is Nick and I am very much looking forward to working with you in the coming months. I am currently working in healthcare while studying computer science online through the University of Colorado-Boulder. I have completed several projects using raspberry pis in the past and am excited to build upon what I have learned. I am familiar with C++, Python, Flask, Latex, HTML/CSS and I'm ready to learn more. When I am not working I enjoy cycling, running, camping, hunting, and cooking for my family and friends. 


General Info

- From Tulsa, Oklahoma (Central Standard Time)
